==========

**THIS TOOL IS DEPRECATED**

We are working on a [new CLI](https://github.com/sphereio/sphere-node-cli), in the meantime you can use:
- [SPHERE.IO impex](https://impex.sphere.io) to import/export data into your SPHERE.IO project
- [SPHERE.IO playground](https://impex.sphere.io/playground) to interact with the API
- [sphere-node-product-csv-sync](https://github.com/sphereio/sphere-node-product-csv-sync) to manage your products via the command line
- [Deployent Button](https://github.com/commercetools/sphere-snowflake#deployment) to get your shop running on heroku
